    <p>
      Web development is the process of building websites and applications for
      the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web
      development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s
      all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s
      functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps,
      from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS); all the
      tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by web
      developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding
      (frontend), server-side coding (backend) and database technology.
