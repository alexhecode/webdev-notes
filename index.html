                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
                Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
                development can range from developing a simple single static page of
                plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps),
                electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
                list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web
                engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison,
                client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security
                configuration, and e-commerce development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main
                non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding.
                Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
                changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end
                developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end
                developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user
                browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.

    <h3>A Web Developer...</h3>
    <p>A Web Developer presents their clients' products and services to a wide audience by creating attractive, functional 
      websites. As a web developer you will likely be asked to identify potential site users and design a website to appeal 
      to these constituents. Your work may include meeting with clients to discuss their desires for a website or discuss how 
      to keep their websites functioning and up to date. You might construct the layout of a website, creating a visually 
      interesting home page and user-friendly design. You may also write the content for the website. After a website is up 
      and running, you'll make sure that the site is functional on all web browsers, periodically testing and updating it as 
      needed. A client may also need you to include interactive capabilities on their site using scripting, object-oriented 
      programming languages and/or databases. Source: <a href="https://learn.org/articles/What_Does_a_Web_Developer_Do.html">Learn.org</a></p>

    <center><h1>Reasons to become a Web Developer:</h1></center>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong demand in the job market</li>
      <li>Strong future growth</li>
      <li>High salary</li>

    <center><h2>Strong Demand</h2></center>
    <p>In November 2019, the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> estimated that by the end of the year, at least 53.6% of the global population would be
      using the internet. It is clear from the graph below that based on historical data, there is an upward trend of internet users and that this number will continue to grow.
      As long as the internet is around and the number of internet users continue to increase, it is without doubt that the need for websites, web apps and web services
      will also increase. This explains the strong demand for web developers.</p>

    <br>

    <center><h2>Strong future growth</h2></center>
    <p>The job is listed to have a <em>Very Strong</em> future growth by Job Outlook, an initiative of the Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment.
      This is the highest possible rating. As explained in their <a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/Occupation?search&code=261212">Career Information</a>, future growth is the likely percentage change, compared to all other occupations.
      Moreover, it is indicated that as a Web Developer, you are less likely to be out of work than people who work in other jobs.
      In May 2019, based on the Labour Force Survey data, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment has the projected employment growth for Web Developers at 9.2% for the five years to May 2024.

    <center><h2>Fairly high salary</h2></center>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Salaries/web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm">Glassdoor</a>, the national average salary for a Web Developer is $75,513 in Australia.
      Whereas <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/web-developer">Seek.com</a> has listed that the <strong>most common salary</strong> in Australia is between $65,000 and $75,000. 
      A discrepancy is evident in the two website's numbers, however the numbers do sound good to me! Also - <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/role/frontend-developer">what the heck?</a>
      More research on front-end developer salary in Australia will be needed.
