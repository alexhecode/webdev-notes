    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of
        plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps),
        electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
        list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web
        engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison,
        client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security
        configuration, and e-commerce development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main
        non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding.[2]
        Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
        changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end
        developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end
        developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user
        browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.
