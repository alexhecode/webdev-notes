This repository is a collection of my notes on Web Development. I want to use this repository to track my learning and at the same time apply my knowledge. These notes will be presented as a static web page and will be continually updated as I grow.

As I learn more, I will create a beautiful web app that displays my notes in the browser. I will be able to use this web app in the future as a reference.

All the resources I have used to compile these notes will be detailed in the next section of this README.
